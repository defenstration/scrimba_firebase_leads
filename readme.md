# Scrimba Leads Tracker App

## Overview

This is my app from the Scrimba course on building a web extension and mobile app. Part way through the lesson I changed the app over from Scrimba to work in VS Code with it so I could get the experience developing with Firebase. 

This app is deployed to Netlify, but I have turned the write permissions off on Firebase until I learn more about authentication. 

## Learning 

I have made several projects at this point with HTML, CSS, and JS. This is the first time I have built a mobile app and Chrome extension. I had never used Netlify, Firebase, or uploaded a Chrome extension. This was also my first experience adding a favicon (at favicon.io) and web manifests.
